### Data Dissemination 

Part of EPAR's mission includes a "commitment to open access tools and broadly
accessible dissemination." We hope to empower people in developing countries to
make use of the data we create. As part of this mission, we release all of the
data we create for further research. The STATA .dta files generated by our data curation project can be downloaded below:

* [Download the Full Data Set](https://github.com/EvansSchoolPolicyAnalysisAndResearch/335_Data-Dissemination/archive/master.zip)
    * [Download the Ethiopia Data](https://github.com/EvansSchoolPolicyAnalysisAndResearch/335_Data-Dissemination/raw/master/Ethiopia-ESS.zip)

### Data Tool

In order to make the Data more accessible for everyone, EPAR has created our
online [Data Tool](http://v1008.host.s.uw.edu). This site will allow you to view
indicators directly, or download subset of the data as CSV files for use in your
own research. 

### Code Distribution

The data files were curated using the STATA software package. The code is
licensed BSD 3-Clause Open Source License. It can be downloaded below:

The data tool was created using Python and the Flask web framework. It is
likewise licensed under the BSD 3-clause Open Source License. It can be downloaded below.
