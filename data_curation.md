### Data Dissemination 

Part of EPAR's mission includes a "commitment to open access tools and broadly
accessible dissemination." We hope to empower people in developing countries to
make use of the data we create. As part of this mission, we release all of the
data we create for further research.

### Data Tool

In order to make the Data more accessible for everyone, EPAR has created our
online [Data Tool](http://v1008.host.s.uw.edu). This site will allow you to view
indicators directly, or download subset of the data as CSV files for use in your
own research. 

### Code Distribution

The code to create the data files is available under a BSD 3-Clause Open Source License, along with the data tool. The code for both can be found at the links below:
