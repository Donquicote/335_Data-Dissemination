# LSMS Data Dissemination

Part of EPAR's mission includes a "commitment to open access tools and broadly
accessible dissemination." We hope to empower people in developing countries to
make use of the data we create. As part of that mission we have created this
repository as a resource for fellow researchers and decisions makers. 

The data in this repository were created using the raw
[LSMS-ISA](http://surveys.worldbank.org/lsms/programs/integrated-surveys-agriculture-ISA)
data collected by the World Bank.
